for IPs AbuseIp Database + My honeypot was used!
For domains at this moment Only StevenBlack Hosts was used at time i will upgrade all at my own, thx to y'all

For a Easy use i recomend use Pi-hole or other DNS system to use this hosts more simply, or if u want , u can use it as your hosts file, but you need to add
```
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain
127.0.0.1 local
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1 localhost
::1 ip6-localhost
::1 ip6-loopback
fe80::1%lo0 localhost
ff00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
```
